# Hello, I'm Rapha!! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little about me:

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I am an experienced and passionate technology professional with extensive expertise in network management, including structured cabling, patch panels, and managed switches. I have mastered Windows Server services such as Active Directory (AD), DNS, WSUS, and DHCP, as well as network edge security through firewalls, routing, and VPNs (L2L and C2L) with protocols like L2TP and SSL. My expertise spans firewall technologies like Endian, Firebox WatchGuard, PfSense, and SonicWall.

My experience also includes managing, deploying, and configuring Google Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Drive, and more). I possess advanced knowledge of Linux servers and specialize in deploying and administering Cisco and Unifi AP networks.

Currently, I work with TOTVS Protheus, developing custom programs in ADVPL, applying continuous delivery patches, and monitoring the environment.

I have solid knowledge of IT ticketing systems like GLPI and network monitoring tools like Zabbix. 

In the productivity realm, I excel in advanced Excel and VBA, with intermediate skills in other Microsoft Office tools. 

In development, I graduated from SAP Academy in the ABAP module, with a great passion for the language. I also work as a freelancer developing small to medium full-stack applications using languages such as PHP, Python (with Django), Java, Go, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I have robust knowledge of modern tools like Docker & Docker Compose, along with professional experience in version control using Git & GitHub. I'm skilled in configuring and monitoring web servers like Nginx and Apache and developing BI solutions using SQL, Qlik, and Power BI.

With technical and practical training in Oracle and MySQL database administration and manipulation, I bring a solid skill set to complex and challenging projects.

Married and a proud father of two wonderful girls, I am responsible, curious, and driven by a constant desire to learn and innovate.
